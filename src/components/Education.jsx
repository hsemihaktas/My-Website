          I studied computer engineering at this university, with a primary
          focus on project management and software development, particularly
          within the field of front-end development. With a strong skillset
          encompassing ReactJS, NodeJS, Tailwind CSS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          I am highly experienced in this area. During my time at university, I
          have actively contributed to the front-end development of both a
          property website and an AI Django website.
