          Throughout my studies in Computer Engineering, I have garnered
          extensive technical expertise. My primary focus has been on project
          management and software development, with a particular emphasis on
          front-end development. Thanks to my proficiency in ReactJS, NodeJS,
          Tailwind CSS, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I am well-versed in this
          field. During this period, I participated in the front-end development
          stages for a real estate website and an artificial intelligence Django
          website. My tasks involved designing and developing user-friendly
          interfaces for these projects. These experiences not only enhanced my
          problem-solving abilities but also enabled me to embrace a receptive
          attitude towards tech advancements.
